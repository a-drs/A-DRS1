This is the SECOND and improved version of the 5th assignment - that of identifying duplicate files.

This program uses the concept of HashMap utility provided in Java. Each file encountered is 
stored within a HashMap comprising a key which is a String(filename) and a value which is
a list of Strings(pathnames) of all files that share a common filename.    
Once all the files are scanned, any duplicate occurrences are recorded in a separate HashMap dup,
so that only duplicate occurrences need to be traversed later.

Additionally, it lists all duplicate files at the end of the program, and gives additional information
such as time and size of each file, and allows the user to select which file he desires to delete, and
performs this accordingy.

The user is asked to enter complete path of initial directory or drive.

Steps : 
1)the folder L3_5_V2 is the eclipse project that can be imported into workspace, run using drive.java
2)l3_5_2_program contains the java code
3)l3_5_2_output includes a sample output.

PREFERRED PLATFORM:
			using Java, on Eclipse, on Windows.
