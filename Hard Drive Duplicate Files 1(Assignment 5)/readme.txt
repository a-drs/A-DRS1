This is the first version of the 5th assignment - that of identifying duplicate files.

This program uses a general hashed file concept. Each file encountered is 
stored at a location C:/store, in a series of files. the hashed key is the first letter 
of each filename, depending on which it is added to the file having its first letter as file name.
if that file name is found to already be existing within that file, it is ignored and user is asked
whether or not he wishes to delete the duplicate, and the operation is performed accordingly.


The user is asked to enter complete path of initial directory or drive.
